# httputil

This package provides additional components in order to spawn HTTP servers. The primary aim is to be able to spawn
multiple HTTP servers at once, listening in multiple addresses. It requires the use of standard http.Handler so it works
with other libraries as well.

The httputil package is now released as open source for use by PotatoBeans clients or anyone. It is actively maintained
by PotatoBeans.
